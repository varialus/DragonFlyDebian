istgt (0.5~20120901-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED YET
  * New upstream version
  * Refresh patches by letting hunks beyond there offsets unchanged, with
    these exceptions:
    + Drop fix-as-needed-build.patch: applied upstream
    + Drop fix-autosize.patch: applied upstream conditionally when compiling
      with --enable-symlink-device which we do now.

istgt (0.4~20111008-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix "cannot determine device size from symlink" Apply patch to use stat()
    instead of lstat(). Thanks Michal Suchanek  (Closes: #650212). I apologize
    for the delay, but I was postponing this decision for a long time, given
    it was rejected by upstream for security concerns. I do not share these.
  * Fix "Add support to reload the istgt.conf file." by merging the excellent
    patch Andrew Ruthven <andrew@etc.gen.nz>. Much appreciated (Closes: #679055)
  * Improve init script:
    + Better support fancy outputs
    + Improve failure toleance of the reload handler
    + Log istgt start output to syslog

istgt (0.4~20111008-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix "istgt: ftbs with ld --as-needed" - apply patch which shifts libraries
    in the compiler line after object files. Thanks Julian Taylor
    (Closes: #646272)
  * Fix "ftbfs on squeeze" Add missing build-dependency to dpkg-dev 1.16.1 which
    is required to build the package because we're using dpkg-buildflags to
    generate configure flags. That's guaranteed for Testing, but might be
    helpful to know for backporters. (Closes: #650217)
  * Push standards version to 3.9.3.1 - no further changes required
  * Drop the DMUA field - I don't need it anymore, update my maintainer address

istgt (0.4~20111008-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Add patch `add-istgtcontrol-manpage' which adds a manpage for the
    istgtcontrol command.
  * Check whether istgt is actually running after starting up the daemon in its
    init script. That's required because istgt may fail for the socket setup
    after forking into the background.

istgt (0.4~20110928-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Adapt to dpkg 1.16.1 API changes regarding build flags. This enables
    hardening build flags. This means, istgt is now being built with
    -fstack-protector and other security related build flags.

istgt (0.4~20110907-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Make debian/copyright more readable
  * Provide a non-functional watch file to follow glibc-bsd conventions to
    denote the problem with it in a comment
  * Fix a not detected build failure due to a problem in upstream's Makefile
    for the GNU/Hurd architecture (`make-build-failures-fatal.patch'). This
    patch has been forwarded and merged upstream
  * Remove `handle-destdir.patch' - it has been merged upstream
  * Refresh `fix-installdir.patch'
