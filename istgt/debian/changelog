istgt (0.4~20111008-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix "istgt: ftbs with ld --as-needed" - apply patch which shifts libraries
    in the compiler line after object files. Thanks Julian Taylor
    (Closes: #646272)
  * Fix "ftbfs on squeeze" Add missing build-dependency to dpkg-dev 1.16.1 which
    is required to build the package because we're using dpkg-buildflags to
    generate configure flags. That's guaranteed for Testing, but might be
    helpful to know for backporters. (Closes: #650217)
  * Push standards version to 3.9.3.1 - no further changes required
  * Drop the DMUA field - I don't need it anymore, update my maintainer address

istgt (0.4~20111008-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Add patch `add-istgtcontrol-manpage' which adds a manpage for the
    istgtcontrol command.
  * Check whether istgt is actually running after starting up the daemon in its
    init script. That's required because istgt may fail for the socket setup
    after forking into the background.

istgt (0.4~20110928-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Adapt to dpkg 1.16.1 API changes regarding build flags. This enables
    hardening build flags. This means, istgt is now being built with
    -fstack-protector and other security related build flags.

istgt (0.4~20110907-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Make debian/copyright more readable

    denote the problem with it in a comment
  * Fix a not detected build failure due to a problem in upstream's Makefile
    for the GNU/Hurd architecture (`make-build-failures-fatal.patch'). This
    patch has been forwarded and merged upstream
  * Remove `handle-destdir.patch' - it has been merged upstream
  * Refresh `fix-installdir.patch'
