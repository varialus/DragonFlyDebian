  * Fix "istgt: ftbs with ld --as-needed" - apply patch which shifts libraries

istgt (0.4~20111008-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Add patch `add-istgtcontrol-manpage' which adds a manpage for the
    istgtcontrol command.
  * Check whether istgt is actually running after starting up the daemon in its
    init script. That's required because istgt may fail for the socket setup
    after forking into the background.

istgt (0.4~20110928-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Adapt to dpkg 1.16.1 API changes regarding build flags. This enables
    hardening build flags. This means, istgt is now being built with
    -fstack-protector and other security related build flags.

  * Fix a not detected build failure due to a problem in upstream's Makefile
    for the GNU/Hurd architecture (`make-build-failures-fatal.patch'). This
    patch has been forwarded and merged upstream
  * Remove `handle-destdir.patch' - it has been merged upstream
  * Refresh `fix-installdir.patch'
