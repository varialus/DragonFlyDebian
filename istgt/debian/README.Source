istgt (0.4~20110529-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Unfortunately the upstream author of istgt does not provide any location for
  his upstream tarballs, uscan(1) could examine to learn about new versions.
  All you can do is to have look to his blog [1], where he announces new
  versions (e.g. [2]).

  The tarball itself is reachable through a Wordpress plugin which does not
  allow browsing through releases (e.g. [3]). The announcement page also
  contains corresponding hash check sums.

  Finally please note, tarballs are not versioned, but have a timestamp in it.
  The version of istgt itself can be determined by having a look to
  `src/istgt_ver.h'.

  To (re-)build the source package from the subversion repository, please
  consider using svn-buildpackage [4], although this is not required. Do as
  follows:

  *) $ mkdir ~/tarballs
  *) Put whatever orig.tar.gz tarball you want to build into ~/tarballs
  *) $ svn checkout svn://anonscm.debian.org/svn/glibc-bsd/trunk/istgt
  *) svn-buildpackage

  This will produce source and binary packages in ~/build-area. If you want
  to work in a full source directory, use the following command instead:

  *) svn-buildpackage --svn-export

  This will produce a source directory in ~/build-area where you can work.

  If you don't want to use svn-buildpackage at all, you have to merge
  directories manually. For example do:

  *) $ tar zxfv istgt_0.4~20110529.orig.tar.gz
  *) $ cd istgt-20110529
  *) $ svn export svn://anonscm.debian.org/svn/glibc-bsd/trunk/istgt/debian \
       debian/
  *) $ dpkg-buildpackage
