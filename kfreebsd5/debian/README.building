This package isn't yet specifically designed to support building custom
kernels, but it shoult not be difficult.

Here are the steps you'll need to take:

1. debian/rules setup
2. cp build-tree/src/sys/i386/conf/GENERIC build-tree/src/sys/i386/conf/HOSTNAME
3. change build-tree/src/sys/i386/conf/HOSTNAME
4. edit debian/mk/build.mk, and change the top line that says KERNEL=GENERIC
   to say KERNEL=HOSTNAME
5. debian/rules build
