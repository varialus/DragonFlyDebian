Description: FreeBSD fork of send-pr (from GNU GNATS)
 send-pr is a client utility for sending problem reports to a remote GNATS
 database. This is the FreeBSD version of send-pr, which contains a number
 of enhancements, and is primarily targetted at sending reports to the FreeBSD
 PR database.
 .
 It is useful for Debian maintainers (or even users) of software originated in
 FreeBSD, as it provides an easy way to send patches or feedback to upstream.
