Description: POSIX conformance test suite (dummy package)

 performing conformance, functional, and stress testing of the IEEE
 1003.1-2001 System Interfaces specification in a manner that is agnostic to
 any given implementation.
 .
 This is a dummy package.  If you want to run the testsuite, use the source
 package of the same name (e.g. apt-get source posixtestsuite).
