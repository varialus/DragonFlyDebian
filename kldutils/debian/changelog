kldutils (5.4-3) unreleased; urgency=low

  * Reformat loading/unloading output a bit to make it friendlier to the flood
    of printk's that follow module loading.
  * Add /etc/modules.d/ directory as Guillem suggested.  The /etc/modules file
    is now only for local user editting, packages should use the directory.
