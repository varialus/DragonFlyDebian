kldutils (5.4-7) unreleased; urgency=low

  * Pass module list through a "sort | uniq" filter to avoid duplicate attempts

kldutils (5.4-6) unreleased; urgency=low

  * init.d: Ignore start|stop argument, it should always start (since it runs in
    rcS.d).  Thanks to Aurelien for pointing out.

kldutils (5.4-5) unreleased; urgency=low

kldutils (5.4-4) unreleased; urgency=low

  * During boot, use kldconfig to add /lib/modules/`uname -r` to the module
    search path.

kldutils (5.4-3) unreleased; urgency=low

  * Reformat loading/unloading output a bit to make it friendlier to the flood
    of printk's that follow module loading.
  * Add /etc/modules.d/ directory as Guillem suggested.  The /etc/modules file
    is now only for local user editting, packages should use the directory.

kldutils (5.4-2) unreleased; urgency=low

  * Improve /etc/modules parsing.

kldutils (5.4-1) unreleased; urgency=low
