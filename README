ToDo:
 - Make the kernel source package extract and apply debian patches automatically.
 - Make the kernel compile.
 - Make related packages compile, including the Hammer and Hammer2 file systems.
 - Try to use the kernel with the Hammer or Hammer2 filesystem.
 - Fix any issues that arise.
 - If 'apt-get build-dep' is supposed to include dependencies for building the source package, then add packages fakeroot subversion kernel_wedge to 'apt-get build-dep' for kfreebsd-9.
 - If 'apt-get build-dep' is supposed to include dependencies for building the source package, then add packages fakeroot git kernel_wedge to 'apt-get build-dep' for kdragonflybsd-3.
 - Send kFreeBSD fixes upstream.
 - Port VirtualBox.
 - Take over the world because the DragonFly kernel plus the Hammer file system with low memory block level deduplication plus Debian usability and administration plus VirtualBox virtualization would blow everything else away.

Instructions:
 - These instructions are probably not perfect, so please submit improvements.
 - For development I'm using the 64-bit version of Debian Wheezy in VirtualBox.
 - For testing I'll be using the 64-bit version of kFreeBSD Wheezy and the FreeBSD OS type in VirtualBox.
 - The kFreeBSD Squeeze netboot installer can install kFreeBSD Wheezy. This works at least within the expert option of the installer.

 - The desktop package in kFreeBSD Wheezy is currently broken.
 - At the bottom of this page there is a a workaround for setting the kFreeBSD keyboard layout.
 - I use sudo rather than su because I prefer it. You can disable root logins within the expert option of the debian installer.
 - Using aptitude is preferred over 'apt-get install' for binary package management but apt-get lends itself to written instructions.
 - sudo apt-get build-dep kfreebsd-9
 - Only do the following 'apt-get install' until 'apt-get build-dep' for kfreebsd-9 includes them, the fix for which is on my ToDo list above.
 - sudo apt-get install fakeroot subversion kernel_wedge
 - Only do the following 'apt-get install' until 'apt-get build-dep' for kdragonflybsd-3 includes them, the fix for which is on my ToDo list above.
 - sudo apt-get install fakeroot git kernel_wedge
 - mkdir ~/kbsd-build-comparison
 - cd kbsd-build-comparison
 - mkdir freebsd
 - mkdir dragonflybsd

In one of two console terminals:
 - cd ~/kbsd-build-comparison/freebsd
 - svn checkout svn://svn.debian.org/glibc-bsd/trunk
 - cd trunk/kfreebsd-9/
 - ./debian/rules get-orig-source
 - touch ./debian/control
 - fakeroot ./debian/rules control
 - Figure out what prerequisites need to be run before running dpkg-buildpackage.
 - dpkg-buildpackage
 - Fix errors.
 - Commit to git and push to github.
 - Send fix upstream.
 - Install kFreeBSD.
 - Build and install kernel.

In the other console terminal:
 - cd ~/kbsd-build-comparison/dragonflybsd
 - git clone git://github.com/varialus/DragonFlyDebian.git
 - cd DragonFlyBSD/kdragonflybsd-3/
 - ./debian/rules get-orig-source
 - fakeroot ./debian/rules control
 - Figure out what prerequisites need to be run before running dpkg-buildpackage.
 - Fix errors.
 - Commit to git and push to github.
 - dpkg-buildpackage
 - Fix errors.
 - Commit to git and push to github.
 - Install kFreeBSD.
 - Build and install kernel.
 - Fix errors.
 - Commit to git and push to github.


Setting the kFreeBSD Keyboard Layout:
 - The kFreeBSD installer doesn't set the keyboard layout correctly. This is how I set the layout to dvorak.
 - kbdcontrol -l “us.dvorak”
 - sudo apt-get install console-setup-freebsd console-setup
