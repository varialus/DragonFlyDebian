ToDo

 - Make the kernel source package download and extract automatically.
 - Make the kernel compile.
 - Make related packages compile, including the Hammer and Hammer2 file systems.
 - Try to use the kernel with the Hammer or Hammer2 filesystem.
 - Fix any issues that arise.
 - Port VirtualBox.
 - Take over the world because the DragonFly kernel plus the Hammer file system with low memory block level deduplication plus Debian usability and administration plus VirtualBox virtualization would blow everything else away.

Instructions

 - These instructions are probably not perfect, so please submit improvements.
 - Download and install GNU/kFreeBSD in VirtualBox or some other environment.

 - I'm using the 64-bit version of kFreeBSD Wheezy and the FreeBSD OS type in VirtualBox.
 - The desktop package didn't work for me in kFreeBSD Wheezy.
 - My commands below use sudo rather than su because I disabled root logins in the expert installer.
 - The installer doesn't set the keyboard layout correctly. This is how I set the layout to dvorak.
 - kbdcontrol -l “us.dvorak”
 - sudo aptitude
 - I selected console-setup-freebsd and then console-setup and then installed them.
 - If you're not familiar with aptitude, you could also run the following.
 - sudo apt-get install console-setup-freebsd console-setup
 - Optionally build the kFreeBSD kernel. Instructions continued toward the bottom.
 - The following steps may require dependencies that can be installed by setting up to build the kFreeBSD kernel.
 - I'm using the kFreeBSD package as a template for kDragonFlyBSD.
 - Install git.
 - git clone git://github.com/varialus/DragonFlyDebian.git
 - cd DragonFlyBSD/kdragonflybsd-3/
 - ./debian/rules
 - nano ./debian/rules
 - Fix errors.
 - Commit to git and push to github.

 - Optionally build the kFreeBSD kernel. Continued from above.
 - sudo apt-get build-dep kfreebsd-9
 - sudo apt-get install fakeroot
 - sudo apt-get source kfreebsd-9
 - cd kfreebsd-9-9.0/
 - dpkg-buildpackage
