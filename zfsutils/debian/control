# We really need to declare those dependencies manually. Upstream adds happily symbols
# without providing any version informations for symbols or bumping SONAMES Since those libraries are
# supposed to used within this source package only, we declare a hard dependency to come
# over problems like #645305.
# dpkg-shlibdeps can't help us here, because it only can create unversioned
# dependencies.
