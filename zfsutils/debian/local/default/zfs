# Space-separated list of filesystems you want automated snapshots for.
#AUTOSNAP_FILESYSTEMS=""

# Maximum number of automated snapshots that may be preserved at any
# given time.  This variable is optional; if it isn't set, snapshots
# will increase without limit.  However, note that the number of snapshots
# only grows logarithmically with time, which makes it very hard to fill
# your hard disk (even when running unbounded).
