 * According to ANSI (section 2.2.4.2), the values below must be usable by
 * #if preprocessing directives.  Additionally, the expression must have the
 * same type as would an expression that is an object of the corresponding
 * type converted according to the integral promotions.  The subtraction for
 * INT_MIN, etc., is so the value is not unsigned; e.g., 0x80000000 is an
 * unsigned int for 32-bit two's complement ANSI compilers (section 3.1.3.2).
 * These numbers are for the default configuration of gcc.  They work for
 * some other compilers as well, but this should not be depended on.
