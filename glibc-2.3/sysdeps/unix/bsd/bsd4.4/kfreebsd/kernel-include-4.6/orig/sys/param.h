 * MAXBSIZE -	Filesystems are made out of blocks of at most MAXBSIZE bytes
 *		per block.  MAXBSIZE may be made larger without effecting
 *		any existing filesystems as long as it does not exceed MAXPHYS,
 *		and may be made smaller at the risk of not being able to use
 *		filesystems which require a block size exceeding MAXBSIZE.
 *
 * BKVASIZE -	Nominal buffer space per buffer, in bytes.  BKVASIZE is the
 *		minimum KVM memory reservation the kernel is willing to make.
 *		Filesystems can of course request smaller chunks.  Actual 
 *		backing memory uses a chunk size of a page (PAGE_SIZE).
 *
 *		If you make BKVASIZE too small you risk seriously fragmenting
 *		the buffer KVM map which may slow things down a bit.  If you
 *		make it too big the kernel will not be able to optimally use 
 *		the KVM memory reserved for the buffer cache and will wind 
 *		up with too-few buffers.
 *
 *		The default is 16384, roughly 2x the block size used by a
 *		normal UFS filesystem.
