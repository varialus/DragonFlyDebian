This directory contains the glue code for using a 64-bit __time_t with a
32-bit __kernel_time_t type. All system calls taking arguments with
'time_t', 'struct timeval', 'struct timespec', 'struct itimerval',
'struct rusage' need some special handling. The benefit is that user programs
will not need to switch from a 32-bit time_t to a 64-bit time_t in 2038.
