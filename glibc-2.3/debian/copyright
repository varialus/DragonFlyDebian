   * The random number generation functions `random', `srandom',
     `setstate' and `initstate', which are also the basis for the
     `rand' and `srand' functions, were written by Earl T. Cohen for

     Regents of the University of California.  They have undergone minor
     changes to fit into the GNU C library and to fit the ISO C
     standard, but the functional code is Berkeley's.

   * The Internet resolver code is taken directly from BIND 4.9.5,
     which is under both the Berkeley copyright above and also:
