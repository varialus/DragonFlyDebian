_Description: Select locales to be generated.
 Locale is a framework to switch between multiple languages for users who can
 select to use their language, country, characters, collation order, etc.
 .
 You can choose locales to be generated by selecting locales you want.
 Selected locales will be saved to `/etc/locale.gen' file. You can also
 manually edit this file. You need to run `locale-gen' after edit the file.

Type: select
_Choices: Leave alone, None, ${locales}
Default: C
_Description: Which locale should be the default in the system environment?
 Many packages in Debian use locales to display text in the correct
 language for users. The default is C but you can change this if you're not
 a native English speaker.
 .
 Note: This will reflect the language for your whole system. If you're
 running a multi-user system where not all of your users speak the language
 of your choice, then they will run into difficulties and you might want to
 leave "C" as the default locale.
 .
 These choices are based on which locales you have chosen to generate.
