Title: The GNU C Library Reference Manual
Author: Sandra Loosemore with Richard M. Stallman, Roland McGrath,
  Andrew Oram, and Ulrich Drepper
Abstract: The GNU C Library Reference Manual
  The GNU C library, described in this document, defines all of the
  library functions that are specified by the ISO C standard, as well as
  additional features specific to POSIX and other derivatives of the Unix
  operating system, and extensions specific to the GNU system.
  .
  The purpose of this manual is to tell you how to use the facilities
  of the GNU library.  We have mentioned which features belong to which
  standards to help you identify things that are potentially non-portable
  to other systems.  But the emphasis in this manual is not on strict
  portability.
