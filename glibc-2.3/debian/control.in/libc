 and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 Timezone data is also included.

Package: @libc@-dev

Priority: standard
Depends: @libc@ (= ${Source-Version})
Provides: libc-dev

Recommends: c-compiler
Suggests: @glibc@-doc
Description: GNU C Library: Development Libraries and Header Files.
 Contains the symlinks, headers, and object files needed to compile
 and link programs which use the standard C library.

Package: @libc@-dbg
Architecture: @archs@
Section: devel
Priority: extra
Depends: @libc@ (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: Libraries with debugging symbols
 Contains unstripped shared libraries.
 This package is provided primarily to provide a backtrace with
 names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to interpret core
 dumps. The libraries are installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be
 used by placing that directory in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
 Most people will not need this package.

Package: @libc@-prof
Architecture: @archs@
Section: devel
Priority: extra
Depends: @libc@ (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: Profiling Libraries.
 Static libraries compiled with profiling info (-pg) suitable for use
 with gprof.

Package: @libc@-pic
Architecture: @archs@
Section: devel
Priority: optional
Conflicts: libc-pic
Provides: libc-pic, glibc-pic
Depends: @libc@ (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: PIC archive library
 Contains an archive library (ar file) composed of individual shared objects.
 This is used for creating a library which is a smaller subset of the
 standard libc shared library. The reduced library is used on the Debian
 boot floppies. If you are not making your own set of Debian boot floppies
 using the `boot-floppies' package, you probably don't need this package.
