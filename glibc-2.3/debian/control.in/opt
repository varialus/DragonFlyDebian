Package: libc6-v9
Architecture: sparc
Section: libs
Priority: extra
Pre-Depends: @libc@ (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: Shared libraries [v9 optimized]
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for the UltraSPARC v9 ABI. It only
 needs to be installed on UltraSPARC machines. If you install this on a
 non-UltraSPARC, it wont even be used.
 .
 WARNING: Some commercial programs do not work well with these libraries.
 Most notably, IBM's JDK. If you experience problems with such
 applications, you will need to remove this package.

 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for i586 machines. Only install this
 if you have a i586 class CPU (check the output of `uname -m'). This
 usually includes all standard Pentium class systems (including clones
 such as AMD). For Pentium Pro, Pentium II/III and Celeron, you should
 check libc6-i686 package.
