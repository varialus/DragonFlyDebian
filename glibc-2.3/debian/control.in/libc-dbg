Description: GNU C Library: Libraries with debugging symbols
 Contains unstripped shared libraries.
 This package is provided primarily to provide a backtrace with
 names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to interpret core
 dumps. The libraries are installed in /usr/lib/libc_debug and can be
 used by placing that directory in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
 Most people will not need this package.
