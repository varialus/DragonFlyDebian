.SH NAME
nscd.conf \- configuration file for Name Service Caching Daemon
.hy 0
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I /etc/nscd.conf
configures the caches used by
.BR nscd (8)
as well as some generic options.
.BR nscd (8)
is able to use a configuration file at a different location,
when supplied with the
.IR -f &quot;, &quot; --config-file
command line option.

.PP
The configuration file consists of a set of lines.
Empty lines, and text after a '#' is ignored.
All remaining lines denote the setting of an option.
White space before and after options, and between
options and option arguments is ignored.

There are two kinds of options: General options influence
.BR nscd (8)'s
general behaviour, while cache related options only affect the
specified cache. Options are set like this:
.nf

  general_option option
  cache_option cache_name option
.fi
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.TP
.BI logfile \ file
Specifies the name of the debug log-file that
.BR nscd (8)
should use if
.B debug-level
is higher than
.BR 0 .
If this option is not set,
.BR nscd (8)
will write its debug output to stderr.
.TP
.BI debug-level \ level
If
.I level
is higher than
.BR 0 ,
.BR nscd (8)
will create some debug output. The higher the level, the more verbose
the output.
.TP
.BI threads \ #threads
This option sets the number of threads that
.BR nscd (8)
should use by default. It can be overridden by calling
.BR nscd (8)
with the
.I -t
or
.I --nthreads
argument. If neither this configuration option nor the command line
argument is given,
.BR nscd (8)
uses 5 threads by default. The minimum is 3. More threads means more
simultaneous connections that
.BR nscd (8)
can handle.
.TP
.BI server-user \ user
By default,
.BR nscd (8)
is run as user root. This option can be set to force
.BR nscd (8)
to drop root privileges after startup. It cannot be used when
.BR nscd (8)
is called with the
.I -S
or
.I --secure
argument. Also note that some services require that nscd run as root, so
using this may break those lookup services.
.SH CACHE OPTIONS
All cache options take two arguments. The first one denotes
the service or cache the option should affect. Currently
.I service
can be one of
.BR passwd ,
.BR group ,
or
.BR hosts .
.TP
.BI enable-cache \ service\ bool
.I bool
must be one of
.B yes
or
.BR no .
Each cache is disabled by default and must be enabled explicitly
by setting this options to
.BR yes .
.TP
.BI positive-time-to-live \ service\ secs
This is the number of seconds after which a cached entry is
removed from the cache. This defaults to 3600 seconds (i. e.
one hour).
.TP
.BI negative-time-to-live \ service\ secs
If an entry is not found by the Name Service, it is added to
the cache and marked as "not existent". This option sets the number
of seconds after which such a not existent entry is removed from
the cache. This defaults to 20 seconds for the
.B password
and
.B host
caches and to 60 seconds for the
.B group
cache.
.TP
.BI suggested-size \ service\ prime-number
This option sets the size of the hash that is used to store the
cache entries. As this is a hash, it should be reasonably larger
than the maximum number of entries that is expected to be cached
simultaneously and should be a prime number. It defaults to a
size of 211 entries.
.TP
.BI check-files \ service\ bool
.I bool
must be one of
.B yes
(default) or
.BR no .
If file checking is enabled,
.BR nscd (8)
periodically checks the modification time of
.IR /etc/passwd ,
.IR /etc/group ,
or
.I /etc/hosts
(for the
.BR passwd ,
.BR group ,
and
.B host
cache respectively)
and invalidates the cache if the file has changed since the
last check.
