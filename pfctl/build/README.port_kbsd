So far this package is basically ported but there are a few points missing
like:

  * Create debian/ dir to make the package
  * Convert Makefile to gnu style ??
  * Port parse.y to gnu yacc ??

Please leave CVS dirs so we can use them to keep in sync with freebsd original
package, as much as we can at least.
