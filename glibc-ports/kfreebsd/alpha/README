Note that even on 64-bit platforms, because __ino64_t != __ino_t, we have
stat64 != stat, fstat64 != fstat, lstat64 != lstat, fhstat64 != fhstat,
glob64 != glob.

Note that on alpha glue code is used in order to use a 64-bit __time_t with a
32-bit __kernel_time_t type. All system calls taking arguments with
'time_t', 'struct timeval', 'struct timespec', 'struct itimerval',
'struct rusage', 'struct msqid_ds', 'struct shmid_ds', 'struct semid_ds' need
some special handling. The benefit is that user programs will not need to switch
from a 32-bit time_t to a 64-bit time_t in 2038.
