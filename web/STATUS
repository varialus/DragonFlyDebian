Current most Urgent things to solve
===================================

 - FIXME: ifupdown does not handle the gateway entry correctly, so do not
   add it in your interfaces file, just add an up hook, that will do as a
   gateway entry:

   auto rl0
   iface rl0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.100
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	broadcast 192.168.1.255
	up route add -net 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1

 - FIXME: gdb: semi-broken. strace works.

 - When you setup a build environment don't forget to install autotools-dev.
   Many packages have outdated config.* and only auto-update when those are
   available (some never auto-update).
