Things needed for d-i:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - installer:
    - Integrate our cdboot/mfsroot-based boot process into the cdrom setup.

  - UDEBfiscate a few packages:
    - kfreebsd: maybe similar to linux-kernel-di-i386-2.6 ?
    - kfreebsd-loader: get it to build first :P
      Alternatively, fix grub to a point in which kfreebsd-loader is no
      longer needed.
    - freebsd-utils
      - freebsd-utils itself
      - kldutils
      - net-tools: get it to build first :P
    - ufsutils

  - os-prober: detect GNU/kFreeBSD !

  - net-cfg: includes Linux-specific cruft.  teach it to use ifconfig et al
    from an external package?

  - partman: Should support bsd disklabels?  I'm not sure how we can do this
  without needing to severely modify the UI.

  - debootstrap

  - grub: (we can use kfreebsd-loader temporarily instead)
    - direct loading (with acpi.ko and initrd support)
    - proper ufs2 support
