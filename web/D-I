Things needed for d-i:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - installer:
    - Integrate our cdboot/mfsroot-based boot process into the cdrom setup.

  - UDEBfiscate a few packages:
    - kfreebsd-udeb: maybe similar to linux-kernel-di-i386-2.6 ?
    - freebsd-utils
      - freebsd-utils itself
      - kldutils
      - net-tools: get it to build first :P
    - ufsutils

  - kfreebsd:
    - Either use 6.x (with all the tinyfication fixes), or backport these fixes
    to 5.x.
    - Network drivers are still built into the kernel!  In order to split them,
    we need:
      - hotplug: not hard to port, just a set of scripts (the I/O is done by
      pciutils/usbutils, and we have both in working state).
      - discover: not too hard either.  Just rewrite the functions in
      sysdep/linux/pci.c to use libpci.a instead of /proc.  The rest are ok
      with stubs for now (we basicaly only care about PCI nics ;).

  - os-prober: detect GNU/kFreeBSD !

  - net-cfg: includes Linux-specific cruft.  teach it to use ifconfig et al
    from an external package?

  - partman: Should support bsd disklabels?  I'm not sure how we can do this
  without needing to severely modify the UI.  Important: libparted port will
  _only_ support either 5.x or 6.x kernel, not both at the same time!

  - debootstrap

  - grub: (we can use kfreebsd-loader temporarily instead)
    - direct loading (with acpi.ko and initrd support. argh!)
    - proper ufs2 support
