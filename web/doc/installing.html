	    <p class="contenttitle">3.1. Install media</p>
	    <p>
	    The first, most obvious step, would be to obtain one of the bootable CD images outlined in the last <a href="sysreq.html">chapter</a>.
	    Use your favourite CD/DVD burning software to write the bootable image to disc and configure your system's BIOS to boot from CD if necessary, before rebooting 
	    with the CD inserted.  
	    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">

	    <p class="contenttitle">3.2. Installation options</p>
	    <p>
	    Upon successfully burning and booting the install CD, you will be presented with a custom FreeBSD 'sysinstall' interface.
	    <br/>Of the available installation options, only the following two are relevant to installing Debian GNU/kFreeBSD;
	    </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="note">
	    Express &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begin a quick installation (for experts)
	    <br/>Custom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begin a custom installation (for experts)
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	    <p>
	    The <strong>'Express'</strong> option provides the quickest, most simple way of installing GNU/kFreeBSD, while the <strong>'Custom'</strong> option performs the same 
	    functions, only at the user's specified order and/or pace. If you're just getting started with Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, the <strong>'Express'</strong> option would be 
	    the recommeded procedure.
	    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	    <a id="part1"></a>
	    <p class="contenttitle">3.3. Partitioning (part one)</p>
	    <p>
	    Partitioning is performed using the FreeBSD installer's built-in fdisk. For documentation on fdisk, see the 
	    <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/install-steps.html">Allocating Disk Space</a> section of the 
	    FreeBSD handbook. The first partitioning step involves creating a single FreeBSD disk partition (or 'slice') of type <strong>165</strong>, by pressing the 'C' key, 
	    followed by the 'Q' once finished. This 'slice' will later contain the actual system root and swap partitions.
	    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	    <a id="boot"></a>
	    <p class="contenttitle">3.4. Boot loader</p>
	    <p>
	    You will now be presented with the following bootloader options:
	    </p>

	    <div class="note">
		BootMgr &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install the FreeBSD Boot Manager
		<br/>Standard &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install a standard MBR (no boot manager)
		<br/>None &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave the Master Boot Record untouched
	    </div>

	    <p>
	    There are several options in regards to bootloader support for GNU/kFreeBSD. Regardless of the option you choose under the 
	    bootloader configuration step, every Debian GNU/kFreeBSD installation contains the standard FreeBSD '<strong>/boot/loader</strong>', which can 
	    be chainloaded by GRUB or LILO. If you're installing to a single, dedicated disk without an existing bootloader, select the '<strong>BootMgr</strong>' 
	    option. If you would like to use your existing GRUB installation to boot your Debian GNU/kFreeBSD system, select '<strong>None</strong>' to leave GRUB 
	    intact.
	    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	    <a id="part2"></a>
	    <p class="contenttitle">3.5. Partitioning (part two)</p>
	    <p>
	    After the bootloader setup, you will now need to create your system partition(s).
	    For a basic installation, simple root and swap partitions will suffice. Multiple system slices/partitions are also supported if you prefer.
	    A simple base install uses less than 500MB of disk space, while a graphical installation, including X server and DE/WM, may require up to 1-2GB.
	    New partitions may be created by pressing the 'C' key and following the prompts. Once you're done setting up your partitions, exit fdisk with the 'Q' key.
	    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	    <a id="distro"></a>
	    <p class="contenttitle">3.6. Distribution set</p>
	    <p>
	    You will now be asked to select which 'distributions' to install. Since we want to skip FreeBSD-specific configuration steps such as these, and because our 
	    installation CD contains only a small base system, you <strong>must</strong> select the '<strong>Minimal</strong>' distribution.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    After selecting the '<strong>Minimal</strong>' distribution, you will be prompted to select the installation media you'd like to use.
	    At the time of writing, CD media is the only supported method of installation for Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.
	    To begin the installation, select the following option:
	    </p>

	    <div class="note">
		CD/DVD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install from a FreeBSD CD/DVD
	    </div>

	    <p>
	    A short while after the base system is extracted from the install CD, you will be prompted to switch virtual terminals by pressing
	    <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>F3</strong>, where further package installation and configuration will take place.
	    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	    <a id="pconfig"></a>
	    <p class="contenttitle">3.7. Base package configuration</p>
	    <p>
	    Upon switching virtual terminals (<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>F3</strong>), you will be asked to configure your timezone settings, after which, 
	    configuration of the essential core Debian packages will be performed. At certain points during the package setup, you will be asked to select any 
	    additional kernel modules to be loaded at boot time, as well as whether you'd like to participate in the package popularity survey.
	    Once the configuration of the base packages is complete, you will be prompted to select "No" from the displayed dialog, which will return you to the 
	    initial install menu.
	    </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
	    <a id="finish"></a>
	    <p class="contenttitle">3.8. Finishing installation</p>
	    <p>
	    If you decided on the '<strong>BootMgr</strong>' option in the bootloader section of the installation, you should be able to reboot straight in to your new 
	    system by selecting '<strong>X Exit Install</strong>' from the bottom of the main menu screen. If you chose not to install a bootloader and would like to 
	    use your existing GRUB setup to boot Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, see the <a href="post.html#grub">'GRUB'</a> section for configuration details.
