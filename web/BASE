This document lists the current status of packages in base + build-essential.

Packages in base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

glibc			pending patchset (both in debian and upstream).  See
			trunk/glibc-2.3-head/.

ncurses			FTBFS.  patch in BTS.
sysvinit		initscripts uninstallable.  pending upload (#349984).
util-linux		though one.  both upstream and debian uncooperative.  we could
			ditch it, but then we miss important things like getopt(1).

freebsd-utils		needs to be ported and properly packaged.  any takers?
kfreebsd-loader		won't build easily on glibc environment
kldutils		clean, waiting to be uploaded
ufsutils		still in experimental



kfreebsd-amd64 only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dpkg			FTBFS (needs to Build-Depend using [linux-any] wildcard)
