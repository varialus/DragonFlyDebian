This document lists the current status of packages in base + build-essential.

Packages in base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

glibc			pending patchset (both in debian and upstream).  See
			trunk/glibc-2.3-head/.

db3			config.{guess,sub} update.  Maybe we could ditch this
			package instead?

gdbm			libtool update (in BTS)

ifupdown		#339834 (is that critical?)
ncurses			FTBFS.  patch in BTS.
util-linux		tough one.

freebsd-utils		needs to be ported and properly packaged.  any takers?
kfreebsd-loader		won't build easily on glibc environment
kldutils		clean, waiting to be uploaded
ufsutils		still in experimental



kfreebsd-amd64 only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dpkg			FTBFS, fixed in SVN (needs appropriate Build-Depend)
