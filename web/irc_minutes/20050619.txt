Minutes
-------

People mentioned:
  aurel32: 	Aurelien Jarno
  braindmg:	Guillem Jover
  bal00:        Hector Garcia
  nyu:		Robert Millan


1) Time of the meeting : Everybody agreed with having the meeting at
   19:00 UTC

2) We need to have more people interested into GNU/kFreeBSD. aurel32
   suggests to send a mail to debian-devel-announce, however we need a
   reason for that. Having a first set of ISO images looks like a good
   excuse. But we fist need a working d-i to do that.

3) braindmg has spoken with Colin Watson about making it more
   portable. Colin is going to integrate a bunch of changes for that 
   into d-i. Then some work has to be done to have a working d-i on
   GNU/kFreeBSD:
    - fixing grub
    - porting parted
    - porting rootskel 
    - have ramdisk working

4) aurel32 explained he started to work on glibc 2.3.2. He started to
   merge the files from glibc-kbsd to the Debian glibc package as
   debian/patches/ files. nyu explained it is a wrong idea because the
   revision history of the files is loosed and because it won't be easy
   to modify them if they are merged into Debian. aurel32 explains the
   idea was to get them included in the Debian package and then 
   upstream. braindmg told it is not a problem if we can get a fast 
   access into Debian glibc. nyu added that the glibc team is quite 
   receptive. aurel32 concluded that we have to try.

5) braindmg told that the next dpkg version will have support for
   linux-any. aurel32 added that a change in the release policy forbids
   to change the build dependencies during the build. That's the end of
   type-handling.

6) aurel32 explained that he has rebuilt 62 out of 72 packages that
   were depending on libpthread2. The latest that have to be rebuild are:  
     aolserver-nspostgres, avifile, erlang, firebird2, gcc-3.4, gnumail,
     gworkspace, libsdl-erlang, rate-engine, wackamole
   They currently fails to build from source, so some more work has to be
   done to get them built.

7) We currently only have gcc-3.3 and gcc-4.0 and so we are now unable
   to follow the C++ ABI transition when it start. We need to work on
   gcc-4.0 as soon as possible. gcc-4.0 should work on GNU/kFreeBSD,
   except for boehm-gc.
   If gcc-4.0 is not available at that time, we will need to stop the
   build daemons, or stop them building C++ stuff.
