		GNU/kFreeBSD IRC meeting, July 03, 2005
                =======================================


The third Debian GNU/kFreeBSD meeting was held from 19:00 UTC to 19:30
UTC on Sunday July 03th.

The next meeting will take place on *Saturday* July 16th at 19:00 UTC.


Minutes
-------

People mentioned:
  aurel32: 	Aurelien Jarno
  braindmg:	Guillem Jover


1) The patch for dpkg to support architectures like linux-any is 
   finished, and have been sent to Scott James Remnant. It should be in
   the next release of dpkg.

2) aurel32 and braindmg would be at debconf 5. It would be nice to have
   a demo machine running GNU/kFreeBSD. Maybe some people will be 
   interested in the port.

3) The Etch release policy forbids build-depends modification at build 
   time. We have to fix our packages that are still doing that. Here is
   the current list:
   - freebsd-sendpr (unstable)
   - kfreebsd5-headers (unreleased)
   - freebsd-moused (unreleased)
   - freebsd-kvm (unreleased)
   - libpipx (unreleased)
   - kfreebsd-headers (unreleased)
    
4) The new version of apt support signed Release files. Thanks to 
   braindmg, the support has been added to gnuab.org, but we have a 
   problem with the following source:
     deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ dists/unstable/main/binary-i386/
   which is not signed.
   
5) aurel32 has bootstrapped the gnat compiler (from gcc-3.4). The 
   compiler itself works well, but the libgnat doesn't pass the 
   testsuite for the tests that are using tasks. braindmg suggests to 
   post the patch and the testcase to the list.

6) aurel32 was unable to attend to the next meeting (he will be 
   returning from debconf), therefore the next meeting has been moved
   to *Saturday* July 16th at 19:00 UTC.
