Minutes
-------

People mentioned:
  aurel32: 	Aurelien Jarno
  bal00:	Hector Garcia
  braindmg:	Guillem Jover
  nyu:		Robert Millan
  otavio:	Otavio Salvador
  tarzeau:	Gürkan Sengün


1) aurel32 explained that io.debian.net, the GNU/kFreeBSD developer 
   machine is now up and works well. An annoucement, including the
   status of the port, has to be posted on debian-devel-announce.
   We just need to wait for gnuab.org to be back again, and for the
   new livecd to be released.
   
2) aurel32 announced that all gcc packages from Debian unstable, that 
   is to say gcc-3.3, gcc-3.4 and gcc-4.0 are building on 
   kfreebsd-i386 without any patch.

3) aurel32 is still porting the glibc. He has changed the sigaction 
   glibc function to use the new sigaction syscall that has been 
   introduced in kFreeBSD 5.0 instead of the old sigvec syscall. This 
   should make possible to use up to 128 signals, which should also make
   possible to free SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 that are currently used by 
   linuxthreads.
   He also have removed the ugly "#include /usr/src/..", and solved the
   namespace collision (glibc and kfreebsd-kernel-headers providing the
   same file).

4) nyu announced that CD burning is now supposed to work on kfreebsd-i386,
   but there is a long dependency chain. cdrtools needs libcam, which he 
   ported and packaged in freebsd-libs source package. This package also 
   include libsbuf, which libcam needs. freebsd-libs also needs libbsd.

5) nyu ported libattr, but it doesn't really work (segfault). This is a
   first step for having libacl.
   
6) nyu also ported busybox, and has sent the patch in the upstream BTS.

7) nyu explained that a some of packages fails to build because the 
   register names have different name on GNU/kFreeBSD. They are named
   eax, ebx, etc. on GNU/Linux and sc_eax, sc_ebx, etc. on GNU/kFreeBSD.
   aurel32 proposed to use an union in the structure definition, so that
   both name could be used.
