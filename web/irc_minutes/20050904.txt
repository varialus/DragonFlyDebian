People mentioned:
  aurel32: 	Aurelien Jarno

  braindmg:	Guillem Jover
  nyu:		Robert Millan
  otavio:	Otavio Salvador
  stu: 		Robert Edmonds

1) braindmg explained he has done some work on mini-dak on gnuab.org.
   He finished his work about the pool split, which means that there 
   aren't anymore mixed -all packages between the Hurd and GNU/kFreeBSD.
   However, pure -all packages are still not accepted yet.
   He also finished the auto-obsoleting functionality, so that only the
   latest package is kept in the archive. The script considers both 
   unreleased and unstable as the same repository, so that it will be 
   possible to produce stats about the kind of packages in unreleased.
   braindmg also added the overrides files to the archive.

2) stu explained that the freebsd utilities depends on the major version
   of the kernel, and thus we will need to have one version for 5.x
   kernels and one version for 6.x kernels. aurel32 added the we 
   currently only support 5.x kernels, but that is something that have 
   to be planned.

3) stu suggested that we provide a meta-package that depends on the 
   various FreeBSD util packages, as well as GNU replacements for 
   userland BSD programs. That's something that has to be discussed.

4) aurel32 explained he has some problems concerning the threads to 
   upgrade the kfreebsd's glibc from 2.3 to 2.3.5.
   There is some work to do on linuxthreads, as a lot of things have
   changed in that part. He also explained that linuxthreads is 
   considered as deprecated, so he started to find alternatives to this
   threading system:
   - NPTL, which is currently linux specific, needs a lot of changes in 
     the kernel, mostly arround the clone() function, and the new futex 
     functionality. 
   - using libpthread from FreeBSD seems to be complicated, as that 
     means the glibc won't be threaded.
   So he decided to continue to work on linuxthreads, but a solution have
   to be found and planned before linuxthreads is simply dropped.

5) aurel32 announced that almost all KDE packages, but kdemultmedia and
   kdeaddons are not available on kfreebsd-i386.
