Debian GNU/kNetBSD installation instructions
============================================

These instructions are NOT for installing a standalone GNU/kNetBSD system.
The base system tarball I provide is NOT standalone and useless for booting.

These instructions are for installing a GNU/kNetBSD development chroot jail
within an existing NetBSD system.

 - Start with a NetBSD install
   - If you use GRUB, you don't need to setup the bootloader since GRUB
     May boot kNetBSD (kernel of NetBSD) with:
       root (hdX,Y,a)
       kernel --type=netbsd /netbsd
   - If you're new to NetBSD, to setup the network:
	- find out the name of your ethernet interface (dmesg, ifconfig -a)
	- ifconfig <interface> <ip_address>
	- route add 0.0.0.0 <gateway> (only if you use a gateway)
     Don't ask me about PPP, I have no idea about it. Read the docs.

 - Create a temporary directory (let's call it /gkn) and untar the base
   system into it (don't untar it on /!!). E.g:

	mkdir /gkn ; cd /gkn
	bunzip2 -c <path_to>/gnu-knetbsd.tar.bz2 | tar --same-owner -xvpf -

 - chroot into it:

	chroot /gkn bash

 - DNS resolving is broken, make sure /etc/hosts has everything you need.
