scan of last available build-logs as of 2008/8
----------------------------------------------

these packages are able to start building (all Build-depends are available),
but config.sub/config.guess does not recognize GNU/kFreeBSD

beware, it does not mean config.sub/config.guess update only 
is sufficient in all cases


Recipe:
-------

Please, update all occurences of config.sub/config.guess,
"find . -name config.sub -o -name config.guess" is your friend.

You can simply copy them manually, but it can also be done 
automatically using the method described in
/usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/README.Debian.gz
