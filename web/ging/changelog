pre0.1.0:
	* Switch to kde.  Add kdm and konqueror.
	* Add a few other packages (gaim, gimp, nmap, etc)
	* mount /proc in /root/startup (oops).
	* up-to-date package set:
	- xorg-x11 with fixed sessreg, so that kdm works.
	- cleaner initscripts with less error messages on startup.
	- fixed netbase (at last!) without ugly "FAILED spoofing protection"
	warning.
	- kfreebsd 5.4 (i486 flavor)

0.0.2:
	Exec init instead of forking for it (we get pid 1)
	Fix X.org auto-configuration by not making the whole /var/{lib,cache}
	readonly.

0.0.1:
	First release.
