0.1.0.rc.1:
	* Package additions / replacements:
	  - Switch to kde.  Add kdm, konqueror and koffice.
	  - Add mdetect (this gets us to skip mouse templates).
	  - Add gaim, gimp, nmap, etc.
	* Notable package updates:
	  - xorg-x11 with fixed sessreg, so that kdm works.
	  - Fixed netbase (at last!) without ugly "FAILED spoofing protection" warning.
	  - New sysvinit, initscripts, freebsd-utils with several GNU/kFreeBSD bugfixes
	  and much cleaner output.
	  - kfreebsd 5.4 (i486 flavor)
	  - kfreebsd-loader includes new customised boot screen.
	* Setup sound via /etc/modules.d/ging
	* Rework pseudo-initrd sequence completely.  It is now much cleaner,
	faster and leaves a beautiful green smell.
	* Don't ask about X resolution.
	* Enable DMA on ATAPI in order to improve CD access.
	* Workaround to shut up "newer than linker.hints" kernel warning.

0.0.2:
	Exec init instead of forking for it (we get pid 1)
	Fix X.org auto-configuration by not making the whole /var/{lib,cache}
	readonly.

0.0.1:
	First release.
