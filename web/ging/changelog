0.1.0.rc.1:
	* Switch to kde.  Add kdm, konqueror and koffice.
	* Add a few other packages (gaim, gimp, nmap, etc)
	* mount /proc in /root/startup (oops).
	* up-to-date package set:
	- xorg-x11 with fixed sessreg, so that kdm works.
	- fixed netbase (at last!) without ugly "FAILED spoofing protection" warning.
	- New sysvinit, initscripts, freebsd-utils with several GNU/kFreeBSD bugfixes
	and much cleaner output.
	- kfreebsd 5.4 (i486 flavor)
	* Setup sound via /etc/modules.d/ging
	* Misc optimisations in pseudo-initrd sequence.
	* Don't ask about X resolution; _do_ ask about X mouse.
	* Enable DMA on ATAPI in order to improve CD access.
	* Workaround to shut up "newer than linker.hints" kernel warning.


0.0.2:
	Exec init instead of forking for it (we get pid 1)
	Fix X.org auto-configuration by not making the whole /var/{lib,cache}
	readonly.

0.0.1:
	First release.
