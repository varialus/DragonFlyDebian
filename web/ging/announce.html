  <p>
    <a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/ging/">Ging</a>, the only
    live distribution based on
    <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a>,
    has made its way to the
    <a href="http://io.debian.net/~rmh/ging/0.1.0/">0.1.0 release</a>. Ging is
    now using <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 3.4 as its desktop.Includes
    a <a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/ging/screenshots/ging_0.1.0.rc1.png">lovely fit together</a>
    mixture of KDE and GNOME apps: Konqueror, Gimp, Koffice, Gaim ...
  </p>

  <p>
    There are even a few SDL-based games featuring
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin">penguins</a>! (who'd be
    afraid of such a nice animal...). For those around who have tried previous
    versions of Ging, you'll be greatly pleased to see the boot time has
    decreased by a factor of ~15 times.
