<title>New Ging releases with KDE</title>

<a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/ging/">Ging</a>, the only live distribution based on <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a>, has made its way
to the 0.1.0 release.  Ging is now using <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 3.4 as its desktop.  Includes a
<a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/ging/screenshots/ging_0.1.0.rc1.png">very complete set of desktop applications</a>:  Konqueror, Koffice, Gimp, Gaim, and
even a few SDL-based games featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin">penguins</a>! (who'd be afraid of such a nice
animal..).  For those around who have tried previous versions of Ging, you'll be
greatly pleased to see the boot time has decreased by a factor of ~15 times.
