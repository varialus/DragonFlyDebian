<h3>The Ging FAQ</h3><p>

<h4>1. What is Ging?</h4><p>

Ging is a Live system that you can burn on a CD.  It is based on <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a>
(which, as its time, is based on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>
and the kernel of <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>).<p>

Ging consists entirely of free software (as per Debian Free Software Guidelines) and has a commitment to remain
this way.<p>

<h4>2. Where are the screenshots?</h4>

<a href="ging.jpeg">Here</a> is mine.  The people at Softpedia also <a href="http://linux.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/Ging-Screenshot-4354.html">
made some</a> that look realy nice.<p>

<h4>3. What does "Ging" stand for?</h4>

It stands for "Ging Is Not Ging".  It is, to my knowledge, the first recursive acronym with an implicit contradiction.<p>

<p>CORRECTION: I have been pointed out that <a href="http://www.xinara.org/">Xinara</a> (Xinara Is Not A Recursive Acronym) pre-dates Ging.</p>

<h4>4. Where can I obtain Ging?</h4>

<p>You can download images (typicaly 150-180 MB in size) via http:</p>

<p><a href="http://io.debian.net/~rmh/ging/">Download iso image (and gpg-signed sha1sum)</a>.</p>

<p>or order cheap CDs online.  The following stores are selling them for a fair near-to-cost price:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pyrasoftware.com/">PyraSoftware</a></p>
<p><a href="http://maxtux.co.uk/">maxtux.co.uk</a></p>

<h4>5. Can I catch you at IRC?</h4>

Yes, we hang in #gnu-kbsd at <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">freenode</a>.<p>

<h4>6. How to build an image?</h4>

Use the scripts from glibc-bsd svn repository (check svn.debian.org), in trunk/web/ging/.<p>
