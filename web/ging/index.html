<h3>FAQ</h3><p>

<h4>1. What is Ging?</h4><p>

Ging is a Live system that you can burn on a CD.  It is based on <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a>
(which, as its time, is based on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>
and the kernel of <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>).<p>

Ging consists entirely of free software (as per Debian Free Software Guidelines) and has a compromise to remain
this way.<p>

<h4>2. Where are the screenshots?</h4>

<h4>3. What does "Ging" stand for?</h4>

It stands for "Ging Is Not Ging".  It is, to my knowledge, the first recursive acronym with an implicit contradiction.<p>

<h4>4. Where can I download it?</h4>

Currently, Ging is distributed through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDonkey_Network">eDonkey network</a>:<p>

<h4>5. How to build an image?</h4>

Use the scripts from glibc-bsd svn repository (check svn.debian.org), in trunk/web/livecd/, plus the patches in
