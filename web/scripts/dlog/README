dlog -- debian log tools
------------------------

This is a (being designed) series of tools to help people (especially porters)
fetch the buildd logs and compare them to the dpkg-buildpackage logs in their
working directory, to ease (w)diff'ing by replacing inappropriate information
(e.g. top-level directory) by placeholders.

At the moment, dlog-fetch is quite operational (although the code is dirty),
and given some answers in a readline environment, logs are fetched under
~/.dlog

Now, dlog-analyze is able to call dlog-fetch to fetch the appropriate logs
given a dpkg-buildpackage log.

Various TODOs:
 - do the real job: replace `pwd` and similar by placeholders
 - prompt the user for the type of output (e.g. diff -u, wdiff, user-defined)
 - accept options or at least parameters in dlog-fetch so that source package
   and source version can be provided by dpkg-analyze;
 - handle the case of user-interruption in the dpkg-analyze while loop;
 - (cosmetics) pretty-print architecture+timestamp.

This is highly experimental and immature, but of course, ideas and fixes are
welcome.
