dlog -- debian log tools
------------------------

This is a (being designed) series of tools to help people (especially porters)
fetch the buildd logs and compare them to the dpkg-buildpackage logs in their
working directory, to ease (w)diff'ing by replacing inappropriate information
(e.g. top-level directory) by placeholders.

At the moment, dlog-fetch is quite operational (although the code is dirty),
and given some answers in a readline environment, logs are fetched under
~/.dlog

In a second phase (hopefully soon), dlog-analyze will be able to call
dlog-fetch to fetch the appropriate logs given a dpkg-buildpackage log.

This is highly experimental and immature, but of course, ideas and fixes are
welcome.
