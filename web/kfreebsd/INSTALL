Debian GNU/kFreeBSD installation instructions
=============================================

- Start with a fresh FreeBSD install
  + Version 5.x
  + With UFS1 (SoftUpdates recommended)
  + In a single filesystem (otherwise the swap script won't work)
  + With minimal options
  + GRUB with UFS1, you do not need to install the FreeBSD bootloader since
    GRUB may boot kFreeBSD (kernel of FreeBSD):
       title Debian GNU/kFreeBSD
       root (hdX,Y,a)
       kernel /boot/loader
  + GRUB with UFS2, you will have to install the FreeBSD bootloader and use
    a chainloader:
       title Debian GNU/kFreeBSD
       rootnoverify (hdX,Y,a)
       makeactive
       chainloader +1
- Create a base system system tarball with crosshurd (on a Debian system).
  You will have to hack dpkg-architecture and s/freebsd/kfreebsd/.
  And transfer it to the FreeBSD system.
- Create a temporary directory (let's call it /gkf) and untar the base
  system into it (don't untar it on / !!)
- Swaping the sytems:
  + Place the "swap" script somewhere except under /gkf.
  + Use: "swap /gkf" to swap /gkf with /. Make sure nothing but / and /dev is
    mounted when you run it !! Note this may well trash your existing
    FreeBSD system, don't have important data on it!
  + After you run it, your base system is GNU/kFreeBSD.
- FIXME: You will need a proper /etc/fstab otherwise it will barf at start.
- FIXME: There is no /etc/hosts.
- Cross your fingers and reboot!! If all goes well you'll see some errors
  with the init script, then init will spawn 8 getty's and you'll be able to
  login your GNU/kFreeBSD system.
