The IRC log above describes how to setup an X server.  Obviously, I was too
busy to document it properly.  Feel free to add decent notes to install.html.

19:03 < tarzeau> i need to edit some x config file or update x?
19:03 < tarzeau> X: user not authorized to run the X server, aborting.
19:06 < tarzeau> i don't have /dev/psaux ?
19:06 < tarzeau> should i dist-upgrade ?
19:13 < nyu> X must be run as root, don't ask me why.  I have this hack to do
             it as user:
19:13 < nyu> #!/bin/bash -e
19:13 < nyu> export DISPLAY=:0
19:13 < nyu> sudo xinit /usr/bin/sudo -u `whoami` x-window-manager -- -nolisten
             tcp
19:14 < nyu> /dev/psaux is a linuxism
19:14 < tarzeau> oki thanks
19:14 < nyu> you should configure xserver-xfree86 with the default mouse config
19:14 < nyu> and then edit manualy
19:14 < nyu> you want something like:
19:15 < nyu>         Option          "Device"                "/dev/sysmouse"
19:15 < nyu>         Option          "Protocol"              "SysMouse"
19:15 < nyu> ah, and apt-get install moused
19:15 < nyu> and edit /etc/moused.conf
19:15 < nyu> shouldn't all this be documented? :(
