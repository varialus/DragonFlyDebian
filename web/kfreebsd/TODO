TODO
====

This is the TODO list for GNU/kFreeBSD. If you want to work on any of this,
_please_ send us a mail to ask about it first (glibc-bsd-devel).
It's likely that work is already started and we can give you more details on
the particular issue.

Tasks are in no particular order. Subtasks are sorted by priority (or at least
that's the intention).

 - Glibc (http://www.nongnu.org/glibc-bsd/)
   - DNS is broken.
   - semctl () has some sort of undetermined breakness. Clint Adams found
     this when trying to fix fakeroot, but didn't give more details.
   - pass "make check"
   - sync with current CVS. (merge into upstream, etc).
   - update kFreeBSD headers.
 - Xfree86
   - Merging patches into upstream
 - Buildd
   - Get an MTA working (Requires to fix DNS in Glibc first)
   - Wait for libtool and config.guess to fix/release/spread.
 - Binutils
   - Fixed in upstream, but need to fix ld.so in Glibc for the latest version
     to work (libbfd is just picky about that now).
   - pass "make check"
 - FreeBSD
   - Nathan made some packages of FreeBSD components (see p.d.o/~utsl).
   - We'd like to get some of these rewriten semi-portably and replaced
     (mount, ifconfig, etc). This is a long-term transition. For now, it'd
     be nice to have wrapper scripts that have the same I/O than their
     GNU/Linux sisters.
   - Update: They're in gnuab repo now. We have ifconfig (in inetutils) and
     will have route/inetutils and mount/sysutils soon.
 - GDB
   - Doesn't load debugging symbols, so it's not much useful.
   - Maybe when built with latest binutils it will work.
   - Or when ld.so is fixed, or when ld.so and libc are built with latest
     binutils, or when the day is rainy and mars and the moon are aligned.
 - GRUB / PUPA
   - Add UFS2 support (upstream is working on that, see #212340)
   - Fix userspace emulator to work on kFreeBSD-based systems. See
       http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grub/2003-07/msg00067.html
       http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grub/2003-02/msg00060.html
 - LiveCD
   - Now that GRUB supports iso9660
