TODO
====

This is the TODO list for GNU/kFreeBSD. If you want to work on any of this,
_please_ send us a mail to ask about it first (glibc-bsd-devel).
It's likely that work is already started and we can give you more details on
the particular issue.

I'd be nice if tasks and subtasks were sorted by priority. It'd be also nice
if all tasks were fixed. We goalt neither of these though :P

 - Glibc
	- resolver is broken.
	- semctl () has some sort of undetermined breakness. Clint Adams found
	  this when trying to fix fakeroot, but didn't give more details.
	- mount () is broken (declaration doesn't match implementation, IIRC)
	- pass "make check"
	- sync with current CVS. (merge into upstream, etc).
	- update kFreeBSD headers.

 - Xfree86
	- Xfree86 no more.

 - Xorg / modular X
	- Port whatever that is going to replace Xfree86 4.3 in Debian. AFAIK
	  modular xserver has purged all these kernel-dependant interfaces.
	  It'd help if someone could clarify wether the next leap will be to
	  monolithic Xorg or to the modular experimental branch of Xorg.
	  In case of monolithic Xorg, my Xfree86 4.3 patchset can be reused.

 - Buildd
	- Get an MTA working (Requires to fix resolver in Glibc first)
	- Wait for fixed libtool and config.guess to spread (see #)

 - Binutils
	- Fixed in upstream. Push upstream fixes into Debian (#248182).
	- The ld.so problem (see #246825) is not fixed in upstream. Guillem,
	  can we forward the current patch? #246825 awaits your confirmation!
	  [ Have to make sure the patch is enterely correct ]
	- Pass "make check".

 - FreeBSD
	- freebsd-buildutils is in official archive now. You can use it to
	  build FreeBSD sources (which heavily depend on their make, awk, etc)

	- kfreebsd5. I'm preparing a package based on Nathan's. This time for
	  kernel of FreeBSD 5.2.1, build with freebsd-buildutils and linking
	  userland components with Glibc only.

	- freebsd-utils. This is a hacked package built from staticaly-linked
	  binaries. It'll eventualy be rewriten semi-portably and replaced
	  (mount, ifconfig, etc). This is a long-term transition. For now,
	  it'd be nice to have wrapper scripts that have the same I/O than
	  their GNU/Linux sisters.

 - GDB
	- Ported in upstream. Too bad kfreebsd-headers has more bugs than a
	  Florida swamp and GDB heavily depends on them. It won't build for
	  now.

 - GRUB
	- Fix userspace emulator to work on kFreeBSD-based systems. I fixed
	  this in upstream. Me lazy bitch gotta propagate this to Debian.

 - LiveCD
	- Now that GRUB supports iso9660. We could start checking if d-i
	  supports GRUB as the _cdrom_ bootloader, and fixing it otherwise.
	  Then porting d-i would earn us a LiveCD automagicaly I believe.
	  Note: Even if GRUB supports iso9660, it can't build kfreebsd
	  directly (yet) but through /boot/loader.gz. So we'll probably
	  have to add real kfreebsd support to GRUB.
