TODO
====

This is the TODO list for GNU/kFreeBSD. If you want to work on any of this,
_please_ send us a mail to ask about it first (glibc-bsd-devel).
It's likely that work is already started and we can give you more details on
the particular issue.

I'd be nice if tasks and subtasks were sorted by priority. It'd be also nice
if all tasks were fixed. We goalt neither of these though :P

 - Glibc
	- Ipv6 is broken with non-::1 hosts (this breaks resolver).
          Workaround: apt-get install totd
                      echo nameserver ::1 > /etc/resolv.conf
          Nathan pointed out this:
            http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/glibc-bsd-devel/2003-October/000092.html
	- Sync with current CVS. (merge into upstream, etc).
	- Update kFreeBSD headers.

 - Xorg / modular X
	- Port whatever that is going to replace Xfree86 4.3 in Debian. AFAIK
	  modular xserver has purged all these kernel-dependant interfaces.
	  It'd help if someone could clarify wether the next leap will be to
	  monolithic Xorg or to the modular experimental branch of Xorg.
	  In case of monolithic Xorg, my Xfree86 4.3 patchset can be reused.

 - Binutils
	- Fixed in upstream. Push upstream fixes into Debian (#248182).
	- The ld.so problem (see #246825) is not fixed in upstream. Guillem,
	  can we forward the current patch? #246825 awaits your confirmation!
	  [ Have to make sure the patch is enterely correct ]
	- Pass "make check".

 - FreeBSD
	- freebsd-buildutils is in official archive now. You can use it to
	  build FreeBSD sources (which heavily depend on their make, awk, etc)

	- freebsd-utils. This is a hacked package built from staticaly-linked
	  binaries. It'll eventualy be rewriten semi-portably and replaced
	  (mount, ifconfig, etc). This is a long-term transition. For now,
	  it'd be nice to have wrapper scripts that have the same I/O than
	  their GNU/Linux sisters.

 - GDB
	- Ported in upstream.

 - GRUB
	- Fix userspace emulator to work on kFreeBSD-based systems.  This
	  is supposedly fixed but I haven't tested it yet (rmh).
	- Fix kfreebsd loader so we can boot directly the kernel and not need
	  the FreeBSD loader.

 - LiveCD
	- Test current livecd.sh in SVN and make sure it generates working
	  iso images.
	- Use the thing as a base for d-i.

 - Split out libuptimed
	- See bug #259477
