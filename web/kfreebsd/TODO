TODO
====

This is the TODO list for GNU/kFreeBSD. If you want to work on any of this,
_please_ send us a mail to ask about it first (glibc-bsd-devel).
It's likely that work is already started and we can give you more details on
the particular issue.

I'd be nice if tasks and subtasks were sorted by priority. It'd be also nice
if all tasks were fixed. We goalt neither of these though :P

 - Glibc
	- Ipv6 is broken with non-::1 hosts (this breaks resolver).
          Workaround: apt-get install totd
                      echo nameserver ::1 > /etc/resolv.conf
          Nathan pointed out this:
            http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/glibc-bsd-devel/2003-October/000092.html
	- Sync with current CVS. (merge into upstream, etc).
	- Update kFreeBSD headers.

 - Xorg / modular X
	- Port whatever that is going to replace Xfree86 4.3 in Debian. AFAIK
	  modular xserver has purged all these kernel-dependant interfaces.
	  It'd help if someone could clarify wether the next leap will be to
	  monolithic Xorg or to the modular experimental branch of Xorg.
	  In case of monolithic Xorg, my Xfree86 4.3 patchset can be reused.

 - Binutils
	- Fixed in upstream. Push upstream fixes into Debian (#248182).
	- The ld.so problem (see #246825) is not fixed in upstream.  We have
	  a patch in the bug that is acceptable for debian, but not for
	  upstream.  Guillem rewrote the patch in a way that upstream likes,
	  but his patch got obsoleted with an upstream update and no longer
	  works.
	- Pass "make check".

 - FreeBSD
	- Merge patches from freebsd-buildutils and kfreebsd6 into upstream.

	- freebsd-utils. This is a hacked package built from staticaly-linked
	  binaries. It'll eventualy be rewriten semi-portably and replaced
	  (mount, ifconfig, etc). This is a long-term transition. For now,
	  it'd be nice to have wrapper scripts that have the same I/O than
	  their GNU/Linux sisters.

 - GDB
	- Ported in upstream, but it doesn't work properly.  As a workaround,
	we use freebsd-gdb package instead.

 - GRUB
	- Fix userspace emulator to work on kFreeBSD-based systems.  This
	  is supposedly fixed but I haven't tested it yet (rmh).
	- Fix kfreebsd loader so we can boot directly the kernel and not need
	  the FreeBSD loader.  (The debian package has a patch by Guillem
	  which does this, but doesn't work reliably enough to merge it yet).

 - LiveCD
	- Test current livecd.sh in SVN and make sure it generates working
	  iso images.
	- Use the thing as a base for d-i.

 - Split out libuptimed
	- See bug #259477 

 - xterm is horribly fucked (I use rxvt instead)
