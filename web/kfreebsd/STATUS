Current most Urgent things to solve
===================================

 - FIXME: ifupdown does not handle the gateway entry correctly, so do not
   add it in your interfaces file, just add an up hook, that will do as a
   gateway entry:

   auto rl0
   iface rl0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.100
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	broadcast 192.168.1.255
	up route add -net 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1

 - FIXME: DNS resolving is broken, make sure /etc/hosts has everything you
   need. MX resolving won't work so MTA doesn't as well [working on it].
 - FIXME: ps is broken.
   (Workaround: Just copy the /bin/ps from the FreeBSD chroot)
 - FIXME: df is broken when not specifying any mount point)
   (Workaround: Just copy the /bin/df from the FreeBSD chroot)
 - FIXME: inetutils, /var/log/news missing, no /dev/xconsole.
 - FIXME: terminal broken, does not handle Ctrl-C nor Ctrl-Z.
 - FIXME: glibc has DNS broken. thus no SMTP.
 - FIXME: gdb: broken. strace works.

 - FIXME: start-stop-daemon does not stop daemons. ??
 - FIXME: ipv6 broken. from glibc. ??

 - ?? /tmp bad perms no go+w ??
