Common practices and problems found when porting to GNU/k*BSD
===============================================================

Non Clean Builds
----------------

When you have to do *any* changes to the source that are needed to build
it, please add a new changelog entry and append a "+kbsd", "+kfreebsd",
"+knetbsd", "+hurd" or "+gnu" as apropriate to the version, so we can
track what should be integrated to upstream or to the Debian maintainer.
Also change the suite from "sid" to "unreleased".

Config scripts (config.guess and config.sub)
--------------

You must have the latest config.guess and config.sub. Copy them from
"/usr/share/misc/config.*". Then please add a "+cfg" to the version.
Change the suite as well to "unreleased".

Autotools and Libtool
---------------------

If you need to update libtool via libtoolize, you will have to be sure
you update the libtool.m4 file as well so that it is in sync with ltmain.sh
otherwise you may get strange linking errors. Then please add a "+libtool"
to the version.

If you autoreconf'ed the package without touching the source files then
append an "+autotool" to the version.

For other not listed autogeneration systems append "+autogen".

Testing for "uname -s" output
-----------------------------

You'll have to the case for GNU/kFreeBSD or GNU/* when appropriate.

Non portable mount(2) calls
---------------------------

Substitute by system(2) with the "-t<filesystem>" argument first.

Preprocessor Variables
----------------------

For kFreeBSD specific code please test if __FreeBSD_kernel__ is defined.

Writing to devfs
----------------

On kFreeBSD's devfs it's only possible to create block/char devices and
symlinks. So if you need to create some thing in /dev, like a named pipe
create it in another place, then symlink from /dev.
