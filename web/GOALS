Build-essential:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			  i486-kfreebsd-gnu
gcc			- all current versions work (gcc-3.3 patch needs
			  to be merged in the debian package).


Other very important stuff we can't live without
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

grub			- or grub2.  whatever that fully works.

freebsd-utils		- no comment
kldutils		- no comment
cdebootstrap		- hangs in infin loop.  also, see #285785
