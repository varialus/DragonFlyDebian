Subject: GNU/kFreeBSD development machine

Hello world,

There is now a Debian GNU/kFreeBSD i386 machine available to Debian
developers. Package maintainers are encouraged to use it to port their
packages to this platform.

The machine's name is "io.debian.net". It was kindly donated by
Aurelien Jarno and is hosted by "ETH Zurich, Department of Physics".
We wish to thank them for their contribution to the GNU/kFreeBSD
development.

How to activate your account:

	gpg --clearsign < ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | mail auth@io.debian.net

	(id_rsa.pub also works)

You should receive an answer within 5 minutes indicating if your action
succeeded or failed. For that, do not forget that you need a valid "From:"
address. Note that you can send multiple ssh keys, but they must all be
sent at once.

# FIXME: when sending the mail, update the relation below
At the time of writing, 81.71% of packages in main are available for
the kfreebsd-i386 architecture. To check if your packages do currently
build on this architecture, you can use Aurelien Jarno's quinn-diff
output for uncompiled or out-of-date packages here:

	<http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/quinn-diff.kfreebsd-i386.html>

If you're going to port something to GNU/kFreeBSD, there's a porting
document describing common porting problems and how to fix them:

	<http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/porting/PORTING>

If you need to contact the io.debian.net admins (e.g. if you need a
package to be installed), send your mail to admin@io.debian.net.
Note: this system is not yet administrated by DSA, so do not send
requests to debian-admin about it.

That's all. For further information, you might want to check
<http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu>, or if you have questions join
us at the glibc-bsd mailing list, or #gnu-kbsd IRC channel in freenode.
