Subject: GNU/kFreeBSD development machine

# Things to do before sending announcement:
# - Generate a new livecd (with new kernel packages, new boot method, etc)

Hello world,

There is now a Debian GNU/kFreeBSD machine available to Debian developers.
Package maintainers are encouraged to use it to port their packages to this
platform.

# FIXME: replace XXX below
The machine's name is `io.debian.net'.  It was kindly donated by XXX and is
hosted by XXX.  We wish to thank them for their contribution to GNU/kFreeBSD
development.

How to activate your account:

	gpg --clearsign < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | mail auth@io.debian.net

	(id_dsa.pub also works)

# FIXME: when sending the mail, update the relation below
At the time of writing, 81.66% of packages in main are available for
GNU/kFreeBSD.  To check if your packages do currently build on GNU/kFreeBSD,
you can use Aurelien Jarno's quinn-diff output for uncompiled or out-of-date
packages here:

	http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/quinn-diff.kfreebsd-i386.html

If you're going to port something to GNU/kFreeBSD, there's a porting document
describing common porting problems and how to fix them:

	http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/porting/PORTING

# FIXME: replace XXX below
If you need to contact the io.debian.net admins (e.g. if you need a particular
package to be installed), send your mail to XXX.  Note: this system is not yet
administrated by DSA, so don't send requests to debian-admin about it.

That's all.  For further information, you might want to check
http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu, or if you have questions join us at
the glibc-bsd mailing list, or #gnu-kbsd IRC channel in freenode.
