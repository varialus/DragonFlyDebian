TODO
====

This is the TODO list for GNU/kFreeBSD. If you want to work on any of this,
_please_ send us a mail to ask about it first (glibc-bsd-devel).
It's likely that work is already started and we can give you more details on
the particular issue.

I'd be nice if tasks and subtasks were sorted by priority. It'd be also nice
if all tasks were fixed. We goalt neither of these though :P

 - ifupdown when used with static IPs does not handle the gateway entry
   correctly, so do not add it in your interfaces file.  As a workaround, just
   add an up hook, that will do as a gateway entry:

   [-- /etc/network/interfaces --]
   auto rl0
   iface rl0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.100
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	broadcast 192.168.1.255
	up route add -net 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 > /dev/null
	down route -q flush > /dev/null
   [-- /etc/network/interfaces --]

 - Glibc
	- Update to the current glibc in sid (2.3.5)
	- Sync with current CVS. (merge into upstream, etc).

 - GCC
	- Port boehm-gc so we can enable java etc.

 - Binutils
	- The ld.so problem (see #246825) is not fixed in upstream.  We have
	  a patch in the bug that is acceptable for debian, but not for
	  upstream. Aurelien Jarno fix the kernel instead, but glibc and
	  binutils have to be rebuilt before getting rid of that patch.
	- Pass "make check".

 - FreeBSD
	- Merge patches from freebsd-buildutils and kfreebsd6 into upstream.

	- freebsd-utils. This is a hacked package built from staticaly-linked
	  binaries. It'll eventualy be rewriten semi-portably and replaced
	  (mount, ifconfig, etc). This is a long-term transition.

 - libkvm is ported badly.  It still has some dummy stubs that need replacing
   with decent code.

 - GDB is ported in upstream, but it doesn't work properly.  Maybe it will
   work when we fix libkvm.  As a workaround, we use freebsd-gdb package
   instead.

 - KDE is working well on GNU/kFreeBSD but most of the packages that provides
   libraries need a libtool update. The KDE team has modified the standard
   libtool file so this version has to be patched.
   A bug report has been filed (see http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103758)
   but the patch still hasn't been merged.

 - GRUB
	- Fix userspace emulator to work on kFreeBSD-based systems (currently
	fails when attempting to write into the device)
	- Fix kfreebsd loader so we can boot directly the kernel and not need
	  the FreeBSD loader.  (The debian package has a patch by Guillem
	  which does this, but doesn't work reliably enough to merge it yet).

 - d-i.
   Otavio Salvador is preparing for work on it (discussing dessign stuff with
   the other d-i people).

   Colin Watson has also been working on de-Linuxificating d-i (for the Hurd).

 - xterm fails to run because it's using unsupported ioctls.

 - Package Glibc for the FreeBSD ports collection.

 - type-handling is obsolete and deprecated now. There's a pending patch for
   dpkg that will solve what this tried to solve in a clean way. Please stop
   using type-handling.

 - lipthread2 is still used by a few packages. They should be rebuilt on a system
   without libpthread2.


Big beasts
~~~~~~~~~~

These are presumably somewhere in the libc implementation and are the most
hard to debug from this list.

Look at the bugs/ directory for test cases.  Good luck!
