Notes on GNU/kFreeBSD LiveCD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest version of the LiveCD could always been found at:

  <http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/livecd/>


A script that generates LiveCD iso images dynamicaly can be found at:

  <http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/livecd/livecd.sh>

The resulting image contains a basic rescue system (LiveCD) with GNU/kFreeBSD.
It's usable for simple tasks or for just testing, but doesn't setup writable
filesystems for you or has the development tools installed.

If you want a GNU/kFreeBSD system for development you can use the LiveCD
environment to install it on your hard disk. See INSTALL file for some
guidelines. There's a more ellaborate install guide (made by Joshua Cummings)
at:

  <http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/doc/>
