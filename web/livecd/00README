Notes on GNU/kFreeBSD LiveCD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest version of the LiveCD could always been found at:

  <http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/livecd/>

This LiveCD contains a basic rescue system with Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.
It's usable for simple tasks or for just testing, but it only contains a
very basic system for rescue tasks (no X, no development tools, etc).

If you want a GNU/kFreeBSD system for development you can use the LiveCD
environment to install it on your hard disk.  See the install guide for more
information on that:

  <http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/doc/>

Or if you're looking for a more complete LiveCD environment (GNOME desktop,
development tools, etc), have a look at Ging:

Happy hacking!
