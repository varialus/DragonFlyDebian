The current boot procedure in this LiveCD is based on a patch made by
Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org> for adding direct kFreeBSD loading
support in GRUB:

  http://www.hadrons.org/~guillem/tmp/grub_kfbsd.patch

Kudos go to Guillem for making this possible. The patch isn't yet in
upstream but this is being worked on for GRUB 2.

Friendly,
