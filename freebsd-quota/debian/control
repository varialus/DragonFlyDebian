Description: management of file system quota for UFS
 The tools needed to handle file system contingents
 on GNU/kFreeBSD systems are contained here.

 The utilities supply all necessary manipulations to
 set, activate, and change quota in any UFS partition.
 Quota support must be compiled into the kernel.
